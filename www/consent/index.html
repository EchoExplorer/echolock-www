            <h1>Echolocation Consent</h1>

            <h3>
                <p>This game is part of a research study conducted by Laurie Heller and Pulkit Grover at Carnegie Mellon University and is partially funded by Google.
                The purpose of the research is to understand how people can use sounds (such as echoes) to figure out aspects of their physical environment, such as whether or not a wall is nearby. The game will use virtual sounds and virtual walls to teach people how to use sound to virtually move around in the game. This current release of the app is designed to provide user feedback on the app itself.</p>
            </h3>
            <h2>
                Procedures  </h2>
            <div>
                <p>App users will install a free app on their phone named EchoGrid. Launching the app for the first time will direct users to a consent form. If the user taps the screen to indicate that they are providing informed consent to participate in the research supported by this app, they will be able to begin playing the game. Users will first go through a tutorial that will provide spoken instructions regarding the gestures needed to play the game, such as swiping or tapping on the phone’s screen. Users will need to put on headphones correctly because the game’s sounds will differ between the two ears. Users will play the game for as long as they want to. The game will increase in difficulty as the levels increase. After a certain number of levels have been played, a survey regarding the user experience will appear. The user will be asked to answer up to 18 questions regarding their experience with the app and whether or not they have normal vision. This survey will only happen once.</p></div>

            <h2>
                Participant Requirements  
            </h2>
            <div>
                <p>Participation in this study is limited to individuals age 18 and older. Participants with or without  vision may play this game. Participants need to have normal hearing because the game relies on detecting subtle differences between sounds. Participants must have access to an Android smartphone to play this game.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>
                Risks
            </h2>
            <div>
                <p>The risks and discomfort associated with participation in this study are no greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during other online activities.  Participants will not provide confidential personal information or financial information.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>
                Benefits
            </h2>
            <div>
                <p>There may be no personal benefit from your participation in the study but the knowledge received may be of value to humanity. In theory, it is possible that you could become better at discriminating echoes in the real world by playing this game, but the likelihood of this possibility is not known.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>
                Compensation &amp; Costs
            </h2>
            <div>
                <p>There is no compensation for participation in this study.  
                There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study. </p>

            </div>
            <h2>
                Confidentiality
            </h2>
            <div>
                <p>The data captured for the research does not include any personally identifiable information about you.  Your phone’s device ID will be captured, which is customary for all apps that you install on a phone. You will indicate whether or not you have a visual impairment, but that is not considered to be private health information. The moves you make while playing the game will be captured and your app satisfaction survey responses will be captured.</p>

                <p>By participating in this research, you understand and agree that Carnegie Mellon may be required to disclose your consent form, data and other personally identifiable information as required by law, regulation, subpoena or court order.  Otherwise, your confidentiality will be maintained in the following manner:</p>

                <p>Your data and consent form will be kept separate. Your response to the consent form will be stored electronically in a secure location on Carnegie Mellon property and will not be disclosed to third parties. Sharing of data with other researchers will only be done in such a manner that you will not be identified. This research was sponsored by Google and the app survey data may be shared with them as part of the development process. 
                By participating, you understand and agree that the data and information gathered during this study may be used by Carnegie Mellon and published and/or disclosed by Carnegie Mellon to others outside of Carnegie Mellon.  However, your name, address, contact information and other direct personal identifiers will not be gathered. Note that per regulation all research data must be kept for a minimum of 3 years. </p>
